# Learn Chess Basics

## Overview

**Learn Chess Basics** is a beginner-friendly web application designed to introduce users to the fundamental mechanics
of chess in an interactive and entertaining manner. This app guides users through random chess movements, provides
visual cues, and offers auditory feedback, making it a perfect tool for beginners to familiarize themselves with the
game. To keep the learning experience light and fun, celebratory confetti is triggered upon successful captures.

## Features

- **Interactive Chessboard**: The app features a fully interactive chessboard, powered by `react-chessboard`, that
  updates dynamically based on random moves and user input.
- **Visual Move Suggestions**: After each random move, potential follow-up moves are visually indicated with arrows,
  assisting users in understanding the logic behind chess piece movement.
- **Musical Feedback**: Each valid square click triggers a musical note, courtesy of `Tone.js`, creating a multisensory
  learning experience that combines visual and auditory cues.
- **Celebratory Confetti**: Whenever a piece is captured, celebratory confetti is triggered, making the learning process
  more engaging and rewarding.
- **Automatic Game State Reset**: After each capture, the game automatically resets, ensuring a continuous flow for
  users to practice repeatedly without interruptions or needing manual intervention.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

To get started, ensure you have the following installed on your machine:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (includes npm)

### Steps

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/learn-chess-basics.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd learn-chess-basics
   ```
3. Install the necessary dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

### Running the App

1. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
2. Once the server is running, open your browser and go to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to access the
   app.

## Usage

### Key Interactions

1. **Starting the Game**: On launching the app, a standard chessboard with the starting position (FEN) is displayed.
2. **Visual Move Suggestions**: Arrows appear on the board showing potential moves generated by the game engine, making
   it easier for users to understand piece movement.
3. **Click to Move**: Click on valid squares to move the chess pieces. If the clicked square matches a valid move, a
   musical note will play, providing feedback for the action.
4. **Confetti and Reset**: Upon successfully capturing a piece, confetti will be displayed, and the game state will
   reset for continued practice. The app also triggers a brief melody on completion of a sequence of valid moves.
5. **Musical Learning**: For each valid move sequence, musical notes will play in progression, offering an auditory
   indicator of your success.

### Learning Objectives

The app is designed to:

- Help new players understand valid chess piece movements.
- Provide visual and auditory feedback to reinforce learning.
- Offer an enjoyable, gamified way to practice chess with minimal pressure.

## Project Structure

- **src/App.tsx**: The core logic of the application, handling state management, game flow, and interactions between the
  chessboard and the user.
- **chess.js**: Manages the internal chess logic (move validation, random move generation, game state updates).
- **react-chessboard**: A flexible chessboard component that renders the chess game visually.
- **Tone.js**: Generates musical notes to provide auditory feedback for user interactions.
- **canvas-confetti**: Responsible for the confetti animation triggered after piece captures, enhancing user engagement.

## Dependencies

- **React**: JavaScript library for building the user interface.
- **chess.js**: Chess logic library used for generating moves and managing the game state.
- **react-chessboard**: Renders the chessboard and allows interaction.
- **Tone.js**: Library for creating and manipulating musical sounds.
- **canvas-confetti**: Used for fun, celebratory animations upon captures.

## Future Improvements

- **Chess Rules Explanation**: Add tooltips or overlays to explain specific chess rules as users interact with pieces.
- **Difficulty Settings**: Introduce different levels of AI complexity for random move generation, allowing users to
  challenge themselves.
- **Player vs Player Mode**: Add support for two-player games, allowing users to practice against a friend.
- **Move History**: Display a move history log, helping users track and review moves they've made during the session.
- **More Musical Layers**: Expand the sound feedback by introducing chords or different instruments for different types
  of moves (e.g., captures, checkmates).
